What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, it copies the .git meta-data to the directory.
This needs to be done to begin tracking your files for version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and a commit. It allows you to make temporary changes before affecting either the files of the commit area or the working directory.
